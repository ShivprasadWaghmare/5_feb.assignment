    "   1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "   ans:In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data members)         and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class â€“ a concrete       realization of the class blueprint.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a class called \"Car\":\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.speed = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def accelerate(self):\n",
    "        self.speed += 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    def brake(self):\n",
    "        self.speed -= 5\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.make} {self.model} - Speed: {self.speed} km/h\")\n",
    "Now, we can create objects (instances) of the \"Car\" class:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"Ford\", \"Mustang\")\n",
    "\n",
    "car1.accelerate()\n",
    "car1.display_info()\n",
    "\n",
    "car2.accelerate()\n",
    "car2.brake()\n",
    "car2.display_info()\n",
    "In this example, \"Car\" is the class with attributes like \"make,\" \"model,\" and \"speed,\" and methods like \"accelerate,\" \"brake,\" and \"display_info.\" The objects car1 and car2 are instances of the \"Car\" class, each having its own set of attributes and interacting with the defined methods.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "  2. Name the four pillars of OOPs. \n",
    "  ans:\n",
    "  1.Abstraction\n",
    "  2.Inheritance\n",
    "  3.Incapsulilation\n",
    "  4.polymorphism\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "  3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example. \n",
    "ans:The __init__() function in Python is a special method used in classes to initialize the object's attributes when an instance of the class is           created. It is called automatically when an object is instantiated.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of the Car class\n",
    "my_car = Car(make='Toyota', model='Camry')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the initialized attributes\n",
    "print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "print(my_car.model)  # Output: Camry\n",
    "In this example, the __init__() method initializes the make and model attributes of the Car class when a new Car object (my_car) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "ans:In object-oriented programming (OOP), the \"self\" keyword is used to refer to the instance of the class within the class itself. It allows access to the instance's attributes and methods, facilitating the manipulation and interaction with object-specific data and behavior.\n",
    "5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming where a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (base class or parent class). This helps in reusing code and creating a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Animal:\n",
    "         def speak(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "         def bark(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Dog inherits from Animal, so it can use the speak method.\n",
    "     my_dog = Dog()\n",
    "     my_dog.speak()  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Flyable:\n",
    "         def fly(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Can fly\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class Swimmable:\n",
    "         def swim(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Can swim\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class Amphibian(Flyable, Swimmable):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Amphibian inherits from both Flyable and Swimmable.\n",
    "     amphibian = Amphibian()\n",
    "     amphibian.fly()  # Output: Can fly\n",
    "     amphibian.swim() # Output: Can swim\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Vehicle:\n",
    "         def start(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Vehicle started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "         def drive(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Car is being driven\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class SportsCar(Car):\n",
    "         def race(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Sports car is racing\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     # SportsCar inherits from both Car and Vehicle.\n",
    "     my_sports_car = SportsCar()\n",
    "     my_sports_car.start()  # Output: Vehicle started\n",
    "     my_sports_car.drive()  # Output: Car is being driven\n",
    "     my_sports_car.race()   # Output: Sports car is racing\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In each example:\n",
    "- The base class provides common functionalities.\n",
    "- The derived class inherits from the base class and may add new attributes or methods.\n",
    "- Objects of the derived class can use both the inherited and newly defined functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
